### * Load the global variables
source ("config.r")

### * Load the PCA data
load (file.path (data.dir, "pc1.dat"))

### * Initialize output vector
pc1.var <- c ()

### * Loop over subjects
for (s in names (pc1)) {

    ## ** Loop over vision conditions
    for (v in names (pc1 [[s]])) {

        ## ** Loop over frequency conditions
        for (f in names (pc1 [[s]] [[v]])) {

            ## *** Store the relative variance of PC1
            sdev <- pc1 [[s]] [[v]] [[f]] $ sdev
            pc1.var <- c (pc1.var, sdev)

        }

    }
}

### * Descriptive statistics
show (summary (pc1.var))

### * Plot the PC1 % variance histogram
pdf (file = file.path (figures.dir, "pc1-var-hist.pdf"))
hist (pc1.var, main = "", las = 1, xlab = "variance of 1st PC",
      xlim = c (0, 1), ylab = "count")
dev.off ()
